## Testing your Add-on

To test your add-on, you will need to add the add-on manifest URL to a client.

There are two such clients that you can test with:

- Stremio

- our Add-on Client Demo UI


### Testing in Stremio

Testing in Stremio is easy, simply follow the 2 steps showcased in this image:

### Testing in our Add-on Client Demo UI

We've created an [Add-on Client Demo UI](https://github.com/Stremio/stremio-demo-ui) so developers can test their new add-ons
and as an example client for those that wish to add the Stremio Add-on system to their
own client applications.
